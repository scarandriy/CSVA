    "response": "4 (Highly likely a scam)\n\nThe provided text appears to be a phishing attempt designed to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or downloading malware. Although the message uses elements of a legitimate contest, such as a supposed \"Chrome search contest\" and prize options, there are several red flags that indicate it is a scam:\n\n1. Lack of official branding: Google does not conduct search contests nor send unsolicited emails to users about winning prizes, especially via unofficial channels.\n2. Grammatical errors: The text contains numerous grammar and spelling mistakes that are unusual in an official communication.\n3. Suspicious links or instructions: There is a clear call-to-action for the recipient to \"Choose one of the prizes below\" and \"follow the instructions on your screen.\" These links could potentially lead to malicious websites or download malware onto the user's device.\n4. Urgency tactics: The message states that the invitation will only be open for 15 minutes, creating a sense of urgency to trick users into reacting impulsively without properly verifying the legitimacy of the message.\n\nUsers should exercise caution when encountering such messages and avoid engaging with communications that appear suspicious or too good to be true.",
