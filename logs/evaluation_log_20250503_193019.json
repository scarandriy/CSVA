    "response": "2 (Potential Spam/Scam, but not definitive)\n\nThis image contains multiple elements that make it look like an email with schedule information, software notifications, and links to documents or programs. However, there are some red flags indicating potential scam. For example:\n- The format of the date (Saturday Monday, May 5) is inconsistent and unclear.\n- The text seems to be packed with various items without proper organization or structure.\n- Some parts of the message (e.g., \"Fuse-React- v14.0.2-. demo\") look like software-related notifications but lack any credible source or context.\n- The presence of links to websites (e.g., \"BankerLinks\", \"Books for ProgramsVs May uni\") without proper context can be a potential risk.\n\nWhile the image does not meet the criteria to be considered a clear scam, it is important to remain cautious and verify any information received through unsolicited emails or messages before taking action.",

    "response": "3 (Potential Scam)\n\nThis email contains several elements that are commonly found in phishing or spam messages, such as a suspicious sender address, unprofessional language, and links to unknown websites. Additionally, the request for updating billing information is often used in phishing scams to trick users into revealing sensitive financial information. While there is no clear evidence of a specific threat in this email, it is important to remain cautious and never provide sensitive information through unsolicited messages or emails. It would be advisable to reach out to the genuine Netflix support team through their official website or contact details to verify any requests for updating billing information.",
