    "response": "1 (Very low scam likelihood)\nThis image contains links to several well-known platforms such as GitHub, Moodle, Drive, Overleaf, Crunchyroll, and Scamwatch. These are legitimate websites, which is a strong indication that this image is not attempting to trick users into providing personal information or downloading malicious software. Additionally, the text mentions a \"Cyber Security Visual Asisstant\" project, which further reduces the likelihood of it being a scam as it seems to be related to legitimate cyber security work. However, always remain cautious when interacting with links online and ensure that they are from trusted sources before clicking on them.",
