    "response": "4 (Potential Scam)\n\nRationale: The text appears to be related to a GitHub repository named \"scarandriyICSVA.\" However, the mention of \"Scams Prevention Framework\" and \"Cyber Security Visual Asisstant\" in the project title could be misleading. Such terms are commonly associated with anti-scam or cybersecurity solutions, but the content provided does not provide enough evidence to confirm the authenticity of the project. Additionally, the text seems incomplete and lacks clear context, which adds to the potential scam indicator. Users should exercise caution and do thorough research before engaging with any unfamiliar projects, especially those that involve sensitive data like personal or financial information.",
