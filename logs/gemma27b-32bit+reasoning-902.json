[March 2009] A screen dump, screen capture, screenshot (or screen shot), screengrab (or screen grab) or print screen[1] is an image taken by the computer user to record the visible items displayed on the monitor, television, or another visual output device. Usually this is a digital image using the (host) operating system or software running on the computer, but it can also be a that made by a device intercepting the video output of the display (such as a DVR). That late image converted and saved to an image file such as to JPG, BMP, or GIF format is also called a screenshot. Screenshots can be used to demonstrate a program, a particular problem a user might be having, or generally when display output needs to be shown to others or archived. For example, after being emailed a screenshot, a page author might be surprised to see how his page looks on a different Web browser and can take corrective action. Likewise with differing small software conventions, (particularly such as in a cell phone, tablet, etc.) a sender might have no idea how his email looks to others until he sees a screenshot from another computer and can (hopefully) tweak his settings appropriately.

It attempts to mimic a legitimate banking institution (NAB - National Australia Bank) but uses a free Weebly subdomain, which is unusual for authentic banking websites. Legitimate banks use their own registered domains.\\n2. **Login Page:**  The login page itself is very basic and lacks the security features typically found on genuine banking websites (e.g., SSL certificates indicated by a padlock in the address bar, complex design, multiple security fields).\\n3. **\\\"To exit full screen, press and hold esc\\\"**: This is an odd instruction to be present on a banking login screen.\\n4. **Notice**: The asterisk next to 'Indicates required field' is unusual for a banking login page as well. \\n5. **Face ID and Passcode Buttons**: The presence of these buttons is unusual in that they appear unrelated to the login fields above. This suggests the linked page may try to gain access to the user's biometrics.\",\n  \"scam_indicators\": [\"Suspicious domain name (Weebly subdomain)\", \"Basic login page design\", \"Lack of visible security indicators (e.g. SSL)\", \"Unusual phrase\", \"Unrelated Buttons\"],\n  \"scam_type\": \"Phishing\",\n  \"Scam Probability\": 5\n}\n```",
