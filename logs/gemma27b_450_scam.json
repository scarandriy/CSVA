The use of a subdomain like \\\"godaddysites.com\\\" is common for simple website builders, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a scam. However, the unusual name 'macc-mettasignx' raises a slight concern. There's a cookie consent notice which is a standard practice. The properties themselves seem legitimate.
