    "response": " Based on the provided data, it appears to be a SSL/TLS handshake during an HTTPS connection. This is not indicative of a phishing or scam attempt in itself as it's a normal part of secure web browsing. However, to evaluate if this specific website (which I assume you visited) is safe or a potential scam, you should consider the following:\n\n1. The domain name and URL structure should be trustworthy and familiar, with a secure connection indicated by 'https' in the address bar. Check for any misspellings or unfamiliar extensions (e.g., .ru instead of .com).\n\n2. Look at the padlock icon next to the URL in your web browser. Make sure it is closed and shows the website's name, not just a generic label like \"Secure Connection.\"\n\n3. Check the certificate details, especially the issuer, subject, and validity period. If they seem suspicious or unfamiliar, this could be a red flag.\n\n4. Watch out for poor design, grammatical errors, or suspicious content on the website itself, as these can indicate a potential phishing attempt.\n\n5. If you entered sensitive information (such as login credentials or financial data) and received an unexpected email or notification asking for more information, this could be a sign of a scam.\n\nIf you're still unsure, it may be best to err on the side of caution and contact the legitimate organization using a verified contact method instead of clicking on any links in the suspicious communication.",

However, it's always important to verify the authenticity of such output if you're unsure about the source. In this case, the source seems to be the operating system itself, so the Scam Probability score would be low (1).\n\nTo verify the source and ensure the information is legitimate:\n\n1. Check if the command prompt or file explorer window opened as a result of a deliberate action by the user or due to an automated process (e.g., scheduled task, script execution).\n2. Look for any unfamiliar commands or processes in the output that could indicate unauthorized access or malicious intent.\n3. If the source is uncertain, consider consulting with a trusted system administrator or IT professional for further evaluation and assistance.\n\nIn summary, the given image appears to show a system snapshot or terminal output, and it seems safe without any signs of a potential scam. A Scam Probability score of 1 has been assigned accordingly.",
